Want to number all the elements in an array?

Want to find the location of a specific element?
`if let idx = array.index { someMatchingLogic($0) }`
Want to transform all the elements in an array?

Want to fetch only the elements matching a specific criterion?
`array.filter { someCriteria($0) }`

`lazy` for intermediate Sequence or Collection. 
Using the `lazy` property gives the standard library explicit permission to store the closure and the sequence in the result, 
and defer computation until it is needed.
